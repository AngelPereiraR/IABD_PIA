Declaration of Venice 1998:
Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders
The Intemational Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP)
is the intemational organization of national societies committed to child and adolescent psychiatry, ps y-
chology and allied professions. For more than sixty years, IACAPAP has been an intemational advocate for
children and families and for the professions that serve them. Major goals are to facilitate the provision of
preventi ve and treatment services, to enhance the training and the work of mental health professionals, and
to promote the advancement of knowledge and the sharing of information across nations to improve the
quality of care and treatment that is available.
Autism and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are the most serious child psychiatric disorders.
Autism affects one child in every 1,500 and associated pervasive developmental disorders affect one child
in every 200 or 300. Individuals with autism a nd PDD are found in every nation, in all ethnic groups, in all
types of families, and in every social class. Arising during the first years of life, autism and pervasive d e-
velopmental disorders affect the vital areas of psychological and behavioral deve lopment, generally through
the life span. Children and autism and associated disorders are impaired in the development of their social
relations, communication, and emotional functioning, and are burdened in their adaptation to life in the
family, in sch ool, and in the community. They suffer from serious behavioral and emotional symptoms
including over -activity, stereotypy, repetitive and restricted range of activities, anxiety, and self -injurious
behavior. Most individuals with autism, although not al l, are also i ntellectually disabled (mentally retarded)
and many are non -verbal (mute). Social disturbances, however, exceed intellectual difficulties and social,
emotional, and behavioral problems of autistic individuals cannot be explained solely as a result of inte l-
lectual disability.
Advances in scientific and clinical research during the past decade have resulted in m ajor advances in
understanding and treatment. The Intemational classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD 10) and the
Diagno stic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, fourth edition (DSM IV) pr o-
vide a reliable diagnostic system and criteria for autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett's Sy ndrome, and Disi n-
tegrative Disorder. This intemationally utilized syst em enhances intemational collabor ation and sharing of
knowledge. Further phenomenological and biological research is needed on the diagn osis of children with
other types of pervasive developmental disorders, including conditions such as Multiple Complex Deve l-
opmental Disorder/Psychotic Disharmony.
Psychological research has substantiated the centrality of social impairments in autism. Developmental
and neuropsychological research suggest that individuals with a utism have an inborn or early appearing
impairment in the understanding and use of soc ial information and in the formation of reciprocal social
relations. Research on communication demonstrates disturbances in various areas of language use and
communication.
There is no single, known cause for autism and PDD. Neurochemical findings have impl icated the role
of serotonergic systems; neuro -imaging studies have indicated possible alterations in brain structures and
differences in the ways in which individuals with autism process social information; and g enetic research
has provided eviden ce for contributions of genetic vulnerability and perhaps specific genes.
Intervention strategies should start as soon as possible, during the first years of life, based on careful,
individual asses sment of strengths and problems. Specially trained pr ofessionals working in collaboration
with parents should develop a comprehensive treatment plan. As the child develops, a lifetime perspective
should be devised that will change with maturation and changes in the individual's strengths and needs.
Compo nents of a comprehensive treatment menu include individual behavioral therapies to remediate
specific symptoms; education to promote social, emotional, and language development; family support and
guidance to help sustain the child in the family; recrea tional programming to enhance emotional matur a-
tion; life -skill programs to promote adaptation; vocational training to allow for community -based work;
adequate schooling to facilitate participation in age -appropriate groups and cultural values; psychothe rapy
for promoting social and emotional competence and help cope with anxieties and other troubles; and med i-
cation for specific areas of symptomatology, as needed. The goal of intervention should be to allow the
individual with autism to remain within t he family and community, to the extent possible, and to have his
or her autonomy, individuality, and dignity respected.
Communities and nations should be able to provide individuals with autism and PDD with a range of
options for education, treatment, and living situation. The spectrum of services should allow an individual
to receive treatment and education that is suitable for his or her specific needs and strengths, age, and fa m-
ily situation.
Even with optimal treatment, the vast majority of indi viduals with autism remain impaired in social,
communicative, emotional and adaptive functioning throughout their lives. The future prognosis for these
individuals will depend on advances in basic and clinical neuroscience and their applications to trea tment.
Promising areas include studies of the molecular biology of brain development; the biological basis of s o-
cialization and communications; neuropharmacology; neuro -imaging; and genetics.
Many disciplines must be involved in the care and treatment of individuals with autism and in the a d-
vancement of scientific knowledge. These professions include child and adolescent psychiatry, psychology,
speech and language, special education, genetics, developmental neuroscience, pharmacology, and the full
range of biomedical specialties concemed about brain development and function. In addition, special e x-
pertise is needed in the organization and management of programs, financing systems, and lifetime pla n-
ning. Within nations, there should be centers of ex cellence in autism and PDD to engage in systematic,
multidisciplinary research; train specialists; disseminate information; and evaluate, treat and support ind i-
vidual children, adolescents and adults, and their families.
Intemational collaborations ca n serve important functions in promoting high quality research; sharing
information, methods, and data; developing and tes ting treatment methods; and experimenting with diffe r-
ent systems for early diagnosis, intervention, and delivery of care and educat ion.
Research on autism and associated disorders will help to develop concepts, research methodologies, and
treatment approaches that can be utilized in relation to other, early onset and emergent developmental, ps y-
chiatric, and serious em otional disor ders.
IACAPAP firmly end orses the following principles:
1. Nations and communities should develop clinical systems for early diagnosis and evaluation of young
children with serious developmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autis m.
2. Treatment should be in itiated as early as possib le, and continue throughout the life-span, as needed.
3. Children and their fam ilies should be provided with a range of treatment and care options, with the
major goal of impro ving adaptation, reducing symptoms, promoting maturation, and maintaining the i n-
dividual with autism within the family and community. All intervention should be specifically related to
individual needs and strengths, and trea tments should be carefully evaluated fo r effectiveness and safety.
4. Treatment planning should be based on collaborations between professionals from various di sciplines
and the fa mily; treatment and care should also consider the wishes of the individual with autism and
PDD, to the extent that this is possible, and r espect the individuality, autonomy, and dignity of the ind i-
vidual and family.
5. A broad range of biological and behavioral research is needed to u nderstand the biological b asis of
autism and associated conditions, neuropsychological features, and effective beha vioral and biological
(including pharmacological) interventions. Genetic research, m olecular biological research, neuro -
imaging, neurochemistry, neuro -pharmacological studies, and cogn itive neuroscience studies are esp e-
cially pro mising. Research is also needed on behavioral, educ ational and psychological inte rventions.
6. Programs of training -both in clinical care and research -are needed to ensure the highest levels of sc i-
ence and r esearch. Standards for clinical care should be developed to guide such training.
7. All interve ntions and r esearch studies must conform to the highest level of ethical consi derations;
also, there is an eth ical r esponsibility by professionals to test their methods and to promote the a d-
vancement of know ledge.
IACAPAP asserts the importance to nations of well -funded, high quality, ethically delivered educ ation
and treatment for individuals with autism and PDD, and to all children and adolescents with ser ious psych i-
atric and developmental disorders. To assure the creation and maintenance of optimal systems of mental
health and special education, govemmen t, private organizations, professionals, families, and adv ocates
need to work together.
